When it comes to Web Development, there are no limits. You could go for days on end being fascinated by the complexities of the development process and admiring the beautiful designs of [various websites](https://www.awwwards.com/). 

The internet is an amazing platform to learn new skills and look up all sorts of things that interest you, but considering the massive amount of resources available, it could be a little overwhelming to begin.


**Let’s start from where it all started:**

## Brief History

**1989 - This is as old as it gets, folks.**

It was the dark ages of web design. 
The name is quite literal as the screens were black and few monochrome pixels lived therein. Designs were made by symbols and the Tab key.

Web Development has come a long way since the days of dial-up internet. 


Now developers have full flexibility and control over the code.With the help of various frameworks (more on that later), you can actually make your own web components! The workflow is way easier, and the possibilities are sky-high!

## Structure of Web Development: 
Web consists of two major parts **Frontend** and **Backend**. In basic terms, frontend is everything you see on a webpage. It is the part of the site with which a user interacts directly. 

Whereas, backend is where it gets ugly. It is the brains of the application where your data, application logic, etc is stored. The parts developed in the backend are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.


Frontend can be built using 3 languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
1. **HTML** (Hyper Text Markup Language) sets the skeleton for the web page. 
2. **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheet) controls the appearance of the webpage. It can be thought of the makeup for the skin. 
3. **JavaScript** is the frontend’s brain. This is responsible for the magic on sites that make them interactive. 


Backend consists of 2 major layers: 
1. **Web Server** 
2. **Database Server**
<br>

Putting it in the simplest terms, a web server is where the contents of a website are stored. It is inside a web server that is Database is stored. The storage facility can be thought of as the web server and it provides serving dynamic HTML content to any client requesting it. (i.e. when you type www.example.com in your web browser. This essentially means you are requesting the content stored in the website www.example.com )

A Database Server is more of a software component. It deals in providing database services. It is usually controlled by the Database Management System you use. It is ever-ready to offer information sought by its clients. 

 Yes, there are several instances where they work together too. Suggest you to see the example Conclusion section [here](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-web-server-and-vs-database-server/) for better understanding. 

## How do we start? 

 Starting with frontend is a good idea. It helps you develop an interest as you can easily see what you are doing.

You can begin with (Frontend):
1. Grasping [HTML](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-steps-understanding-basic-html-code/)
2. Grasping [CSS](https://www.cssbasics.com)
3. Understand the concept of HTML DOM
4. Understand Basic JavaScript 
5. Use Bootstrap
6. Basic Knowledge of Networking
7. Git (Version Control)
8. Package Manager
9. Framework of JavaScript (Angular/Vue.js/React)

For Backend: 
 1. Learn a [Language](https://www.educba.com/back-end-programming-languages/)
 2. Databases: Relational Database (MySQL, Postgresql) <br>**OR**<br>
  NoSQL Database (MongoDB)
ORM, Transactions, JSON
(Java/Python/PHP/NodeJS/etc.) -> To  run a local server on
 3. APIs -> (Authentication)
 4. Caching
 5. Testing
 6. Web Security Knowledge
 7. Web Sockets
 8. Web Servers
