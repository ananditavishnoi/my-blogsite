When it comes to Web Development, there are no limits. You could go for days on end being fascinated by the complexities of the development process and admiring the beautiful designs of various websites. (insert link for best web designed website)

The internet is an amazing platform to learn new skills and look up all sorts of things that interest you, but considering the massive amount of resources available, it could be a little overwhelming to begin.

Let’s start from where it all started:

1989 - this is as old as it gets, folks. 
The dark ages of web design - quite literally actually, as the screens were black and few monochrome pixels lived therein. Designs were made by symbols and the Tab key. 


Web Development has come a long way since the days of dial-up internet. 

Now developers have full flexibility and control over the code.With the help of various frameworks (more on that later), you can actually make your own web components! The workflow is way easier, and the possibilities are sky-high!

Structure of Web Development: 
Web consists of two major parts Frontend and Backend. In basic terms, frontend is everything you see on a webpage. It is the part of the site with which a user interacts directly. 

Whereas, backend is the brains of the application where your data, application logic, etc is stored. The parts developed in the backend are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.

Frontend can be built using 3 languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) allows you to create the webpage. This is where your frontend data is represented.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) controls the appearance of the webpage. It simplifies the process of applying different styles to the webpage.
JavaScript is the frontend’s brain. This is responsible for the magic on sites that make them interactive. 

Backend consists of 2 major parts: Web Server and Database Server. Putting it in the simplest terms, a web server is where the contents of a website are stored. It is inside a web server that is DB (where data is stored) is stored. The storage facility can be thought of as the web server and it provides serving dynamic HTML content to any client requesting it. (i.e. when you type www.example.com in your web browser. This essentially means you are requesting the content stored in the website www.example.com )

A Database Server is more of a software component. It deals in providing database services. It is usually controlled by the Database Management System you use. It is ever-ready to offer information sought by its clients. 

Yes, there are several instances where they work together too. Suggest you to see the example Conclusion section here for better understanding. <insert link>

This difference between the two confused me at first too, so don’t get worried too much. Try watching this video. <insert good video>

Alright, now we have a basic understanding of the web structures. 

“All of this is fine, but how do I actually start?”
Great question! 
Let’s dive right into it. 

Starting from frontend is a good idea. It helps you develop an interest as you can easily see what you are doing.
You begin by:
HTML
CSS 
Understand the concept of HTML DOM
Understand Basic JavaScript 
Use Bootstrap
Basic Knowledge of Networking
Git (Version Control)
Package Manager
Framework of JavaScript (Angular/Vue.js/React)


BackEnd: 
Learn a Language
Databases
Relational Database (MySQL, Postgresql)
NoSQL Database (MongoDB)
ORM, Transactions, JSON
(Java/Python/PHP/NodeJS/etc.) To  run a local server on
APIs- (Authentication)
Caching
Testing
Web Security Knowledge
Web Sockets
Web Servers

### 感

看完这个帖子我突然觉得有些凄凉，按理说这是最好的时代，你头上明明顶着21世纪的太阳，但是抬头看，依然有阴霾；你明明生长在一个蓬勃发展的时代，但是你心里依然充满不安。

更可怕的是，你的身体就像一块劣质的电池，充电需要充很久，不但充不满而且用得快。你看起来很忙，忙得根本停不下来。可你实际上又很穷，穷得不敢停下来。至于体面地生活，遥远得像是下辈子的事儿。

你学会了说：“谈钱伤感情”，可后来才发现，没钱才伤感情。

你学会了说：“要保持独立的人格，不被金钱左右”，可后来才发现，没钱的灵魂根本就没法硬气地站立。

你学会了说：“要孝敬父母、让在乎的人过上幸福的日子”，可后才发现，没钱根本就做不了孝子，也给不了在乎的人幸福。

### 奈

看，你学了多少年的对错，可现如今才明白，现实只讲输赢。
